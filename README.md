# Random Meteo App

This is a simple app that shows the current weather in a random city. It uses the Meteo France and Wikipedia API to get the weather data.
This app has been realised with the [BastiUI's Figma mock-up](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1245835973918406873/bastiui-random-meteo)

## Installation

This app is powered with Docker. You can run it with the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up
```
